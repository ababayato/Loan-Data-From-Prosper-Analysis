## Summary of Findings

In the exploration I found out that though business was amongst the top 3 reasons people take loan, self-employed people took less loans than people who are employed. We found that the higher the salary income does not affect taking a loan as people who earn 100k+ still make up a huge part of the population that collect loans while people who earned more were generally granted high loan amounts.

Outside of the main variables of interest, I verified that people with good credit score are the ones that take loans the most. People in California tend to take more loans and Professionals and Computer Programmers took more loans than people from other occupations. 3 years was also the most popular loan term as opposed to 5 years and 1 year.

Retired and unemployed people rarely took loan, most likely owing to the fact that the chances of defaulting would be extremely high.


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on the different reasons people take loans and the features that influence their likelihood to get a loan and the loan amount available to different types of borrowers. I start by introducing the loan original amount variable with the tranformed histogram followed by the borrower's occupation and employment status. Afterwards, I introduce how different variables influence the loan original amount.
